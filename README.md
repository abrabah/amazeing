An attempt to implement some of the ideas discussed at gamasutra [Algorithms for making more interesting mazes](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/HermanTulleken/20161005/282629/Algorithms_for_making_more_interesting_mazes.php)

## setup

Run the following commands to get started

### Yarn (recommended)

1. `yarn`
1. `yarn run watch`

### npm (if you don't have yarn)

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run watch`

Once you are up and running, open `js/config.js` and start hacking ;)
